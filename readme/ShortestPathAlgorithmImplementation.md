# Shortest Path Algorithm Implementation

# Project Description

This project is regarding the implementation of a shortest path algorithm which finds the shortest path in two vertices in a graph.Even there are so many shortest path algorithms my implementation is based on Dijkstra Algorithm.The program finds shortest path distance to a node which is based on the given node.

# Implementation 

1.First it takes number of nodes as a user input in order to create a graph.The graph will automatically creates nodes starting from 1 up to number of inputs.
2. The function dijkstra accept two arguments, a graph and source then output the vertex and its distance from source node.


# Limits :
1.The graph creates nodes from 1 to input number (user input).Therefore user shouldn't give a minus number.
2.To create graph user should know the number of nodes in graph before hand.
